There are many observed links between residential mobility - the change of occupants in a home or area over time, henceforth referred to as churning (1) - and poverty (1-6). For those who stay in neighbourhoods while others move frequently, the lack of community links and social bonds can exacerbate poor mental health (2) or maintain a concentration of poverty due to in-migration of poor households and out-migration of wealthier households (1, 3). For those migrating households driving churning rates, such high-frequency moves can lead to negative education and health outcomes for children (4) or general dissatisfaction with housing conditions, especially when combined with other drivers of deprivation such as unemployment and substance abuse (5). These dynamics can determine general changes and continuities in areas: Coulton et al.'s (6) study of 10 neighbourhoods and their change over time found that changes in in- and out-migration in neighbourhoods were a more important driver of change in neighbourhoods than any changes in the habits, attributes, or behaviours of those who live in neighbourhoods in the long term. Therefore, for policymakers in Leeds, exploring the relationship between churning and poverty will offer insight into whether churning concentrates poverty in some areas, and therefore presents the opportunity for targeted interventions to relieve deprivation and social isolation.
