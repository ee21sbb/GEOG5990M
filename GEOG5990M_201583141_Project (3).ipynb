I then plot these clusters spatially. After using the group_by command to assess the average values of each cluster, it becomes apparent that the main variable influencing each cluster is the IMD decile, while the average values for churning don't change much between clusters. Though this indicates not much of a correlation between the two variables, it does provide a useful shorthand with which to group the IMD data into three clusters of low, medium, and high deprivation, as opposed to using all 10 deciles."

I use the IMD decile clusters plotted to the boundaries as this is categorical data with fewer variables and therefore fewer colours, so is better as a background colour as it makes the visualisation look less busy and easier to interpret. I then mapped the churn data to the centroids and used a continuous blue colour scale which shows up well on the copper colours of the categorical data. Finally I used a loop function to map the three churn variables in three subplots in order to illustrate changes over time. I also ensured that the colour maps I used did not have overlapping colours so that it is clear which colour corresponds to which variable."
